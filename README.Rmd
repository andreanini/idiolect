## Overview

The `idiolect` R package is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for performing comparative authorship analysis within a forensic context using the likelihood ratio framework [e.g. @ishihara2021]. The package contains a set of authorship analysis functions that take a set of texts as input and output scores that can then be calibrated into likelihood ratios. The package is dependent on [`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io) [@benoit2018] for all Natural Language Processing functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `idiolect` using the `install_github()` function of the `devtools` package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/andreanini/idiolect")
```

## Example

The main functions contained in the package reflect the typical workflow for authorship analysis for forensic problems:

1.  Input data using `create_corpus()`;

2.  Optionally mask the content/topic of the texts using `contentmask()`;

3.  Launch an analysis (`delta()`, `ngram_tracing()`, or `impostors()`);

4.  Test the performance of the method on ground truth data using `performance()`;

5.  Finally, apply the method to the questioned text and generate a likelihood ratio with `calibrate_LLR()`.
