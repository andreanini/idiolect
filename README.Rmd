# *idiolect*: An R package for forensic authorship analysis <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" alt="" />

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-- !!! WARNING: CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT !!! \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

The `idiolect` R package is designed to provide a framework for performing comparative authorship analysis within a forensic context using the likelihood ratio framework. The package contains a set of authorship analysis functions that take a set of texts as input and output scores that can then be calibrated into likelihood ratios. The package is dependent on [`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io) [@benoit2018] for the Natural Language Processing functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `idiolect` using the `install_github()` function of the `devtools` package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/andreanini/idiolect")
```

## Example

The main functions contained in the package reflect the typical workflow for the use of authorship analysis methods for forensic problems:

1.  Input data using `create_corpus()`;

2.  Optionally mask the content/topic of the texts using `contentmask()`;

3.  Launch an analysis (`delta()`, `ngram_tracing()`, or `impostors()`);

5.  Test the performance of the method on known data using `performance()`;

6.  Finally, apply the method to the questioned text and generate a likelihood ratio with `calibrate_LLR()`.
