[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/idiolect)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=idiolect)
<!-- badges: end -->

The `idiolect` R package is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for performing comparative authorship analysis within a forensic context using the Likelihood Ratio Framework [e.g. @ishihara2021; @nini2023]. The package contains a set of authorship analysis functions that take a set of texts as input and output scores that can then be calibrated into likelihood ratios. The package is dependent on [`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io) [@benoit2018] for all Natural Language Processing functions.

## Installation

You can install `idiolect` from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("idiolect")
```

## Workflow

The main functions contained in the package reflect the typical workflow for authorship analysis for forensic problems:

1.  Input data using `create_corpus()`;

2.  Optionally mask the content/topic of the texts using `contentmask()`;

3.  Launch an analysis (e.g. `delta()`, `ngram_tracing()`, `impostors()`);

4.  Test the performance of the method on ground truth data using `performance()`;

5.  Finally, apply the method to the questioned text and generate a likelihood ratio with `calibrate_LLR()`.

Check the website and the vignette for examples.
