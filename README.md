An R package for forensic authorship analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

———- !!! WARNING: CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT !!! ———-

The `idiolect` R package is designed to provide a framework for
performing comparative authorship analysis within a forensic context
using the likelihood ratio framework. The package contains a set of
authorship analysis functions that take a set of texts as input and
output scores that can then be calibrated into likelihood ratios. The
package is dependent on [`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io) (Benoit et al.
2018) for the Natural Language Processing functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `idiolect` using the
`install_github()` function of the `devtools` package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/andreanini/idiolect")
```

## Example

The main functions contained in the package reflect the typical workflow
for the use of authorship analysis methods for forensic problems:

1.  Input data using `create_corpus()`;

2.  Optionally mask the content/topic of the texts using
    `contentmask()`;

3.  Launch an analysis (`delta()`, `ngram_tracing()`, or `impostors()`);

4.  Test the performance of the method on known data using
    `performance()`;

5.  Finally, apply the method to the questioned text and generate a
    likelihood ratio with `calibrate_LLR()`.
