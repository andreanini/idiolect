## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added references to DESCRIPTION.

* Omitted 'Functions for' from title.

* Replaced T/F with TRUE/FALSE.

* Changed the lambdaG_visualize() function so that it does not write in the user's home by default. The user has to provide a path.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
