Ken & Jeff, We would like to extend an invitation to you for an event at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, honoring the Frank Gehry Exhibit which Enron is sponsoring. Frank Gehry, a celebrated architect whose building appears at the end of our Ode to Why commercial, personifies innovation in the way he has "asked why," challenging nearly every convention in his field. Enron will have a table of at the Trustee Opening Gala Dinner on May 16th, with cocktails at 7pm and a seated dinner at 8:30pm. The Gala starts with a private viewing of the exhibition, followed by a seated dinner for people in the Rotunda of the museum. Attendees are comprised of Trustees, government dignitaries, artists, curators and celebrities. Several business unit executives are using this forum to take potential customers and we would like to know if you are interested in attending. Please advise. Thanks, Steve
