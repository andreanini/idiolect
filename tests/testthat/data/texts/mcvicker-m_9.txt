Ken Lay will be hosting a reception for Houston City Council Members and other city officials on Monday, July 31st from 6-7 pm in the 50th floor lobby area. This reception is an opportunity for us to update city officials about Enron������s businesses, and an opportunity for you to meet your local representatives. With the hard copy of this memo, I have attached bios and detailed information on Houston City Council Members, Houston Port Commissioners, the Metro Board, and the Sports Authority board. If you are unable to attend, please designate someone on your management team to represent you. Please RSVP to Maureen McVicker at x31808.
