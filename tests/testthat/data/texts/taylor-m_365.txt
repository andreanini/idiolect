I would very much like to get some time with each of these people while I'm there. I have already arranged some time with Jonathan Marsh on Monday morning since he knows a lot about the ISDA meeting that afternoon. I would prefer, if possible, to have some time with each of Paul Simons and Justin Boyd before the rest of the crew so that I can hear a bit about them before I actually sit down with them. Don't worry if that's not possible. I'd also like to get some time with each of Edmund Cooper, Mark Elliott, Mark Evans, Robert Quick and Marcus Von Bock. Mark Evans would be best towards the end of the stay - maybe lunch on Wed.?
