Mac, Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations: Gas Sales 916,000/day x days 334,340,000/year Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst additional EPS X P/E multiple a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price Nat. Gas Crude Total Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? To me this looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB? Thank you, Phillip
