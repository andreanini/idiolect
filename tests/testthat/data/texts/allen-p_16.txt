Dave, The back office is having a hard time dealing with the million dollars that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped from the Office of the Chairman. Is your understanding that the West desk will receive origination each month based on the schedule below. The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as follows: October November December January February March April May June July August September October November December This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by the Denver desk. The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on MMBtu/Day (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01). The ENA Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense. Let me know if you disagree. Phillip
