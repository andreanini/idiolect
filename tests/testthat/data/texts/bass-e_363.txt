So this is how it will work. Whenever the payment is due (the 18th). You write me a check for $100. I will pay the $1252. You will pay me $100/ month for months ( so you last payment will be made to me on October 18th, 2001). Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS - I cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any exceptions for you. Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract. -Eric
