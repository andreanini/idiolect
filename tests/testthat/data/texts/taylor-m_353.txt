It really was unbelievable. Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast. The water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house. It looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in. Just one more inch and I'd be in big trouble. Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the second floor - a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside. The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped. I got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear ������ no standing water anywhere. By the time I got up in the morning it was all gone. Interstate where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the loop) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges! I didn't see it myself but I hear that was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd. You missed a big one!
