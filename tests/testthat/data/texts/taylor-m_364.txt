I'm still concerned about the terms "price" and "quotation." My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price. That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication. I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated. The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index. Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number. That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments." Do I have this all wrong?
