It looks like we have our teams. We will probably keep the same rules from last year unless anybody has an objection. Still to be determined are league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol. I suggest that we draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26. For those of you that can't make it, you can draft over the internet. We will be using cbs sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person. Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, too early, too late. If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year. You all do not stand a chance! -Eric
