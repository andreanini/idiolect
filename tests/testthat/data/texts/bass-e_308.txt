Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback Sept. 19, By Len Pasquarelli SportsLine.com Senior Writer Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, SportsLine.com has confirmed. "If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not the case," coach Norv Turner said. "But it goes beyond just the quarterback position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general." Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the unbeaten Giants.(AP) In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of the league's most diverse in when it ranked No. overall and second in scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that it might be time for a change. One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have only three completions this year of more than yards, and the longest is yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to tailback Stephen Davis. The Redskins, who averaged yards per completion in with both starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic yards per catch this season. But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter. "There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said. "Right now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere else."
