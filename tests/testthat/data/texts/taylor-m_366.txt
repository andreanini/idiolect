Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed. If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether. We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis. We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week. Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate. Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather). The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered. This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process. The initial list of or counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people. Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis. If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations. Hope this is helpful. Let me know if it makes sense to you. Mark P.S. - Please be careful when sending e-mails to me. There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart. The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine. My name usually has my phone number next to it. We're trying to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us.
