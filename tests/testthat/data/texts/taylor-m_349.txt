Now that we have all migrated to Outlook, please be sure to give everyone in the group access to view your calendar. You will need to grant permissions to all group members both in the "Outlook Today" box at the top of your folders list and in the "Calendar" box. 1. Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and then "Folder List") 2. Left click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up 3. Left click on the "Permissions" tab 4. Add all of the swap group members as "Reviewers" to give them read access Repeat the above process but starting on the "Calendar" line of your folders list. Once everyone has done this, we will all be able to access each other's calendars by using the File Open menu.
