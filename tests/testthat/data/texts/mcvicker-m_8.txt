Want to have fun? Want to get on a game show? Want to help Millions? Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items). Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9. The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes. I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign. Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN!
