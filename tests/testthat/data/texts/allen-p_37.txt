Bob, Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy Gay was on a personal leave. She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time. She frequently came to work before AM to prepare operations reports. Patti worked days a week during this time. If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti. She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time. Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. specialist. Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR. Let me know what is an acceptable cash amount. Phillip
