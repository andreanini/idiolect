Dan, I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions on EOL "Force Majeure" language. Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language? Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones. I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance. Sincerely, Eric Bass x3-0977
