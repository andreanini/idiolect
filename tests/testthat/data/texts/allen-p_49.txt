Bob, Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award. Patti stepped up to fill the gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave. Patti held together the scheduling group for about month's by working 7days a week during this time. Patti was always the first one in the office during this time. Frequently, she would be at work before AM to prepare the daily operation package. All the traders came to depend on the information Patti provided. This information has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size of the west desk positions. Please call to discuss cash award. Phillip
