Description: Carry out comparative authorship analysis of disputed and
    undisputed texts within the Likelihood Ratio Framework for expressing
    evidence in forensic science. This package contains functions that
    implement algorithms for comparative authorship analysis as well as
    functions to measure their performance and to calibrate their outputs
    into Log-Likelihood Ratios.
