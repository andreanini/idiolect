Description: Carry out comparative authorship analysis of disputed and undisputed texts within the Likelihood Ratio Framework for expressing evidence in forensic science. This package contains implementations of well-known algorithms for comparative authorship analysis, such as Smith and Aldridge's (2011) Cosine Delta <doi:10.1080/09296174.2011.533591> or Koppel and Winter's (2014) Impostors Method <doi:10.1002/asi.22954>, as well as functions to measure their performance and to calibrate their outputs into Log-Likelihood Ratios.
