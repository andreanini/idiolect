#' Calibrate scores into Log-Likelihood Ratios
#'
#' This function is used to transform the scores returned by a verification function into a Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR).
#'
#' More details here.
#'
#' @param calibration.dataset A data frame containing the calibration data, typically the output of an authorship analysis function like [impostors()].
#' @param dataset A data frame containing the scores that will be calibrated into LLRs using the calibration data. This is typically the result of applying a function like [impostors()] to the Q texts.
#'
#' @return The function returns a data frame with the LLRs, as well as the verbal label according to Marquis et al (2016) and a verbal interpretation of the results.
