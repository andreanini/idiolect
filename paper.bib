  abstract = {Authorship verification has gained a lot of attention during the last years mainly due to the focus of PAN@CLEF shared tasks. A verification method called Impostors, based on a set of external (impostor) documents and a random subspace ensemble, is one of the most successful approaches. Variations of this method gained top-performing positions in recent PAN evaluation campaigns. In this paper, we propose a modification of the Impostors method that focuses on both appropriate selection of impostor documents and enhanced comparison of impostor documents with the documents under investigation. Our approach achieves competitive performance on PAN corpora, outperforming previous ver-sions of the Impostors method.},
