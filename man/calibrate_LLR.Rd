\title{Calibrate scores into Log-Likelihood Ratios}
\usage{
calibrate_LLR(calibration.dataset, dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{calibration.dataset}{A data frame containing the calibration data, typically the output of an authorship analysis function like \code{\link[=impostors]{impostors()}}.}

\item{dataset}{A data frame containing only one row with the score that will be calibrated into a LLR using the calibration data. This is typically the result of applying a function like \code{\link[=impostors]{impostors()}} to the Q text.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list containing two data frames: a first data frame with the LLR, as well as the verbal label according to Marquis et al (2016) and a verbal interpretation of the results; and a second data frame showing some hypothetical scenarios with prior probabilities/odds being turned into posterior probabilities/odds according to the likelihood ratio obtained.
}
\description{
This function is used to transform the scores returned by a verification function into a Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR).

calib <- data.frame(score = c(0.5, 0.2, 0.8, 0.01, 0.6), target = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
q <- data.frame(score = c(0.35))
calibrate_LLR(calib, q)
